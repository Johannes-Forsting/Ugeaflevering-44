Inheritance is one of the 4 pillars of OOP.  With inheritance you can create the base of a class, which is very useful if you create multiple classes with many of the same attributes.  
When you use extend from classes, you make a super/parent class, which has all the attributes that your base/child classes have in common.  It is important to be very precise in only given the parent class the attributes that the child classes have in common and not all the child classes attributes, since you can always make your child classes "personal", by giving them attributes specific for that class only. 
Any class can only extend   from 1 class, but there can be an endless number of parent classes that extends from one another. Like a family tree you as a child extend from your parents (In java its singular) and your paretns extend from their parents and so on. In the same way, your parent class can have a parent class that it extends from, kinda making it a "grandparent class".

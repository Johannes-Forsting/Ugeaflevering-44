In this specific piece of code we have a main-method and a generateRandomInteger() -method.
If we look at the generateRandomInteger()-method, we can see that it is public, so it is reachable from other classes in the project. 
it is also static, so the method is reachable without creating an object of the class it is in. (In this case the Main class).
We can also see that it returns an integer value, and it takes no parameters to run the method.
Inside the method a variable named "randomGenerator" is defined as the datatype "Random" and is assigned the value "new Random()".
Then the method uses that variable to do a method from the Random class to return an integer value from 0 to the bound number (In this case 9). 
So, to sum it up, it takes no parameters and returns a random number from 0-9.

Inside the main-method a for-loop is executed which runs for 10 iterations. 
In each iteration a variable named "random" is defined as an integer data type, and is assigned the return value of the generateRandomInteger()-metod.
When the value is assigned to the variable, that variable is the printed to the console via a sout. (System.out.println();)
After the 10 iterations the text "Random integers generated" is also printed to the console via a sout.
So the console would look something like this:


2
3
0
8
7
7
1
0
6
5
